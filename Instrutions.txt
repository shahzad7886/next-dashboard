Page COUPONS: 

On the Coupons page, we need to create two cards:

with different colors

With the information in the image, this information will be received later through the backend API.

They will have unlimited cards, we need to create a page, where each page can have up to 5 lines of cards.

Page NEXT DRAWS:

We will have 5 fixed cards, with the information already mocked.

This page will not pull data from the API.

Page INDICATIONS:

On this page, whenever the user accesses the indications page and he has not created his username, the page with the field for him to create his username should be displayed.

Once the username is created, this page is no longer displayed.

On the page where the user visualizes the indications, there will be a table with pagination.
